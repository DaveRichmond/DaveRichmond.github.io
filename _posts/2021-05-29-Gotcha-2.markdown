## Gotcha's
This is an attempt at a series of just writing down the annoying gotchas I encounter through daily life

# Always check the damned datasheet!
One we always know we should do, but sometimes think we know it all and skip it still. This one really bit me in the 
butt recently due to my own hubris.

So I've been designing a little cheap keyboard that uses qmk, has backlighting and all those nice things. Well I went
to assemble one after receiving the LEDs for the backlight. Well wouldn't you know it...
![datasheet packaging details](/assets/2021-05-29/ws2812-datasheet.jpg)
the WS2812B has what looks like a pin one marker on the opposite side of the device. Gah. This is shown quite clearly 
in the datasheet. But it's so not what you'd expect.

So with some clever wiring I've managed to get this prototype sorta functional to make sure that the LEDs do actually 
work. But now I've still got to assemble another just to make sure everything works when assembled correctly.

It was pure luck I got this far on the project without double checking the datasheet. The kicad libraries have
everything done correctly. It was just my own assumption and laziness with skipping what I really should've checked 
that caused this one prototype to need some dodgy wiring to get it functional.

Ideally, I should go back and add extra details to the boards silkscreen to better show the orientation of each LED.
However we can be pretty sure out of my own laziness I'll not do that and get bitten by this again in several months.
If there is any chance of this thing going into production, then it would be worth the time actually making that change.
But it's one of those little projects that I've done for my self and once I get through the 5 prototype boards then 
it'll probably never need another built again.

As always, if there's any lesson to be learned here. It's that the one time you assume everything will be logically
designed, someone will have done something backwards.
