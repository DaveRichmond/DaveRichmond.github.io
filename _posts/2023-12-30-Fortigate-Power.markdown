## Fortigate Power Supply Cables

If you're like me, you have more smaller Fortigate firewalls than you have power supplies for them.
While luckily they just use nothing more than a single 12V rail, unfortunately from the later models of
the -C generation they moved from a barrel jack style power connector to something that looks proprietary.

Turns out it isn't proprietary, its a standard molex part. Mouser sells them 
https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/538-245135-0210 and once you cut it down to get at the wiring so 
you can add a screw terminal barrel jack, you get two cables from one.

I recommend adding crimp ferrules onto the cable so that it's easier to get screw terminals to bite into the cable.
Other than that, it's a very trivial job to make said adapter cable. I will provide pictures here at some point
when I can be arsed to take pictures.

This little tidbit had been floating around in my head for years, and realised I need to document it somewhere in
case anyone else comes across the problem. But I don't take any responsiblity if you accidentally burn your house down
while doing this. If you have the money, get the official power supplies.
